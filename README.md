### Land cover patterns of wind generation infrastructure in Brazil

This repository contains supporting scripts and data related to ongoing research on land cover patterns related to commissioned wind parks in Brazil.


**v1.0** provides scripts and data used for EGU-2019 poster presentation
__*Land cover patterns of wind generation infrastructure in Brazil*__

by *Olga Turkovska*, *Johannes Schmidt*, *Katharina Gruber*, *Felix Nitsch*

Poster presentation is available via Research Gate:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332571308_Land_cover_patterns_of_wind_generation_infrastructure_in_Brazil

Input files necessary for running the script can be easily downloaded via links provided in the section _Download Guide_.

#### Scripts Overview

`0-extract-land-cover.py` extracts the a raster map of land cover for selected wind parks.

`1-explore-land-cover.py` generates a CSV file with technical characteristics of the wind parks, and description of their land cover.

`2-aggregate-land-cover.py` aggregates forest-related land cover subclasses to *forest* land cover class, and agriculture-related landcover subclasses to *mosaic of agriculture and pasture* land cover class.

`3-land-cover-by-year.py` generates a CSV file with land cover overview of the specific year for selected wind parks.

`4-find-conversions.py` generates a CSV file with parameters necessary for initial land cover conversion analysis.

`5-figures.py` generates the figures for the poster.

`MapBiomas_dictionaries.py` contains auxiliary dictionaries for working with MapBiomas dataset.
